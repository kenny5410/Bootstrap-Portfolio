                                My jorney started in Kenya which is a country on the east coast of Africa. That is where I was born and lived until I was four years old. On October 15, 1992 I made my way to Minnesota with my Mom and Dad and settled in Little
                                Canda. I lived there for a year and then moved to the Como Park neighborhood in St. Paul where I spent the rest of childhood. After graduating from Como Park High School I enrolled at the University of Minnesota and gained my
                                Bachelors of Journalism after 4 years.
                                <br></br>   
                                After graduating from the "U" I started my millennial right of passage, moved back home and worked a retail job before I was able to find a consistant job as a bank teller to launch myself into adulthood. As it turned out a bank 
                                teller's life was not a life for me. Growing up I was always interested computers so I decided to change my career and started working in tech support for a transportation techology company based in Minnetonka. This was a much
                                better fit for my skills and I eventually was promoted to help run and support Beta software and hardware projects.
